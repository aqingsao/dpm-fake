# Why this project?
This is a fake DPM implementation

# How to use it?
* Download nodejs in your dev machine, I use version 0.8.1.
* Checkout source code from github, for example to directory 'dpm-fake'
* go to directory 'dpm-fake', and run `npm install`
* run `node app.js`

Then fake dpm will listen on port 3000.
